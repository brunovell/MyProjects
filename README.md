# ðŸ“Š My Data Science Projects

Welcome to my personal **Data Science portfolio**! This repository showcases a variety of projects where I apply data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. Each project is organized in its own folder for easy exploration.

## Projects Overview

- Projects cover topics such as finance analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and more.  
- Each project includes a **README**, **datasets (if shareable)**, and **visual outputs** like dashboards, charts, or screenshots.  
- My aim is to demonstrate **practical skills** in data manipulation, analysis, and storytelling through data.

## About Me

I am passionate about **Data Science** and constantly learning new tools, libraries, and methods.  
I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful insights and building interactive dashboards that communicate results effectively.  

This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase my work, from data extraction and cleaning to analysis and visualization.
