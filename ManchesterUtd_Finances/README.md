# Manchester United Financial Analysis - Last 5 Years

## Overview
This project presents an analysis of **Manchester United's financial performance (2020–2024)** using Power BI.  

The financial data was originally published as **PDF reports** by the club. I extracted the information, transformed it into **Excel** using **Power Query**, and modeled the data to prepare it for visualization.  

This process highlights my ability to:
- Collect and clean data from non-structured sources (PDFs)  
- Use Power Query for **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations  
- Build a reliable data model in Power BI  
- Create interactive dashboards that explore revenues, expenses, and overall financial trends

## Features
- Annual revenues and expenses visualizations  
- Comparison of net profit/loss over the last 5 years  
- Breakdown by revenue sources (player transfers, broadcasting, Matchday, etc.)  
- Interactive charts for detailed insights

### Analysis & Insights

- Revenue decreased slightly due to COVID-19 impacts on **Matchday Revenues**.  
- Expenses remained relatively high, especially **employee and operating expenses**, leading to a small reduction in profit.  
- Transfer expenses were moderate, helping to partially offset revenue losses.  
- On the other hand, **broadcasting revenue skyrocketed due to COVID-19**, increasing from **£140M in 2020 to £254M in 2021** (~81% increase).

**2021/2022:**  
- Revenues recovered significantly, driven by **broadcasting and commercial deals**.  
- Total expenses increased slightly, mainly due to **player wages and amortization**, but profit margins improved.  
- Transfer income contributed positively to overall results.

**2022/2023:**  
- **Matchday revenue** began returning as stadium attendance increased.  
- Operating expenses remained stable; however, transfer expenses spiked due to new player acquisitions.  
- Overall profit remained positive, with growth YoY in both revenue and profit.

**2023/2024:**  
- Revenues stabilized across **all streams**, with broadcasting and commercial revenue being the largest contributors.
