# Manchester United Financial Analysis - Last 5 Years

## Overview
This project presents an analysis of **Manchester United's financial performance (2020–2024)** using Power BI.  

The financial data was originally published as **PDF reports** by the club. I extracted the information, transformed it into **Excel** using **Power Query**, and modeled the data to prepare it for visualization.  

This process highlights my ability to:
- Collect and clean data from non-structured sources (PDFs)  
- Use Power Query for **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations  
- Build a reliable data model in Power BI  
- Create interactive dashboards that explore revenues, expenses, and overall financial trends

## Features
- Annual revenues and expenses visualizations  
- Comparison of net profit/loss over the last 5 years  
- Breakdown by revenue sources (player transfers, broadcasting, Matchday, etc.)  
- Interactive charts for detailed insights
